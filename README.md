This particularly simple UDP protocol based communication process involves using the server as a relay and then distributing the received message to the client. However, there are actually many bugs inside. At present, the function I can achieve is to send messages alternately between clients (unable to open three clients, unable to send multiple messages continuously, and the other party's messages can only be received after sending them themselves. I will implement these functions later). Reminder: If you want to communicate, remember to change the IP address to the server's IP address in "ADDR=('8.130.135.22 ', 21405)"
这个一个特别特别简单的基于UDP协议的通讯交流，其过程是用服务器作为中转，然后将接收的消息分发给客户机，然而，其实里面有很多bugs。目前我能做到的功能是客户机之间轮流发消息（不能开三台客户机，不能连续发多条消息，对方的消息只能自己发送消息后才能接收，这些功能我以后再实现吧）。提示：要想通讯记得把IP改了，”ADDR = ('8.130.135.22', 21405)“中的8.130.135.22换成服务器的IP
